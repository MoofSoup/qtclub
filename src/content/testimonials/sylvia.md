The QRC space has become my home base at City. Last semester was my first semester at this school, and back before I had any friends I found this space. Now it is where I spend most of my time between classes. The qrc is this rly fun mix of a study and hangout space. One day I am roping other students into the game I am working on, then the next I am flipping through old magazines just admiring the design. The music and the art in the space is as diverse as the people.

The walls are covered in student art and pride flags, and they tell a story of community.  Its a space we have made our own, where we can study, hang out, and be ourselves.

The resource centers are being moved to the Student Success Center, this space means too much to lose. I have seen how the engineering club has their own room, and the precedent for departments working with clubs to create student led spaces. I would love your support in helping us figure out how to keep this community we have built together!
