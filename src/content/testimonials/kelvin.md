## How has the QRC space impacted you? 
It’s been a great, inviting space and experience that allows me to enter and recharge in between classes and breaks in classes. Being in community also allows me to speak about what I’m learning in the moment and apply it to the people around me, in a safe, welcoming environment. 
## What about the QRC do you think would be lost in the move to a smaller space?
Community.
