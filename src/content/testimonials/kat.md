## How has the QRC space impacted you? 

I have been able to have room to breathe, to eat comfortably on couches and have a microwave and fridge, space to take a nap between classes, to go to fun parties, to study and do group homework sessions, and to do arts and crafts, to have a job, and to learn more about queer history and things happening in the LGBTQ2ia+ community :)

## What about the QRC do you think would be lost in the move to a smaller space?

Space! But in all seriousness, the queer resource center has room for lounge and for studying. In a smaller space, that separation would not happen and it could lead to a very loud environment that in uncomfortable. Also, students have expressed worry about the new space not having windows that can open and only having recycled air which they often get sick with. In the space right now, the windows can open and there are blinds in case of different weather. The space also brings more students to Cloud Hall, where a lot of classrooms are already located.
