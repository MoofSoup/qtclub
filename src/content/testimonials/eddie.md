## How has the QRC space impacted you? 

The QRC has been a cozy and warm community that has made CCSF Ocean Campus emotionally safer for me.

Logically and Obviously, bigger is better when it comes to space in a room. There is more space for events that involve dancing, more space for those is who have space mental health needs, more space to spread out while working on arts and crafts.
