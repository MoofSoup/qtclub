## How has the QRC space impacted you? 
For the first time in my college life I felt like I had family or friends I could go to no matter what.
## What about the QRC do you think would be lost in the move to a smaller space?
Some of my favorite memories from the QRC are just sitting around with my friends on the couches playing games and hanging out. Since we have a bigger space it feels easier to do so without disturbing other students trying to study or do other work.
